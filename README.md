# OpenGL-sandbox
This is my OpenGL sandbox that uses GLFW and GLAD

## TODO list:
- [ ] Write dependencies for different OSes
- [ ] Write make compiling for windows using mingw
- [ ] Add docs for GLFW dependencies
- [ ] Add make for compiling GLFW for Wayland

## Usage
Just type in terminal:
```bash
make
```
and run main with:
```bash
./main
```
